# SFR Unpacker
Unpacker for Sonic Free Riders package files. 

This program only unpacks! It does not repack files. The files from this game will also require users to decompress them using the standard xbox 360 decompression.



## Usage
This is a command line tool. If running through command line, use:
```
sfrunpack <file>
```

Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the extensionless file into the program and it will extract all of (or the majority of) the contents. 

It will obtain filenames when the file has a filename. All the non-DDS output files will have an index number tied to them. Turns out this game has a lot of duplicately named files in the same package.
